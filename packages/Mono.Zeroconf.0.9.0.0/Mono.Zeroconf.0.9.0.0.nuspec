    <description>Mono.Zeroconf is a cross platform Zero Configuration Networking library for Mono and .NET. It provides a unified API for performing the most common zeroconf operations on a variety of platforms and subsystems: all the operating systems supported by Mono and both the Avahi and Bonjour/mDNSResponder transports.

By using Mono.Zeroconf developers can use a single API that will work regardless of the underlying implementation that a particular operating system uses.

Developers can publish services that will be exposed to other computers on the network and also query the local machines on the network for services that could have been exposed.</description>
